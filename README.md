# Developing Apps for the RICOH THETA S with JavaScript
This is not for public use. I am testing the node
[request](https://github.com/request/request) module with the RICOH
THETA S. So far, it seems to work. I can start a session, take a picture,
get the status of the camera.

There are two JavaScript libraries that work with the RICOH THETA. I suggest
you read the information here:

- [THETA 360 Developers Unofficial API Guide](http://codetricity.github.io/theta-s/index.html#_javascript)

If the link is broken, [this](http://theta360.guide/blog/javascript/2015/12/17/theta-s-nodejs.html)
blog post should still work.
